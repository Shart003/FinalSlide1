<h1><u>Fast Food Grilled Cheeses</u><h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>When you imagine “comfort food,” what is the first dish that comes to mind? Mac and cheese? Baked potatoes? Another pasta dish? How about a freshly grilled cheese with a side of soup? Whether it’s a cool summer evening or a rainy afternoon, it’s safe to say that there’s rarely a bad time for a grilled cheese. As someone who is semi-lactose intolerant with a “you only live once” mentality, I’ve had my fair share of the cheeses. Naturally, the best of these sandwiches are made at home by yourself or a loved one, customized to your hearts content.</p>

<p>But let's be honest: Sometimes, you’re on the road, passing by restaurants, and really craving a grilled cheese sandwich. So, you stop by the nearest In-N-Out or Wawas to grab one because hey, who doesn’t love a cheese-y, grilled delight you didn’t have to spend five minutes of your own time putting together?<p>

<p>While I’ve never been to a Wawas or In-N-Out (unfortunately) and experienced the supposed “incredible” grilled cheeses they serve, I have had my fair share of restaurant grilled cheeses, and have rather <strong>strong</strong> feelings about them. So, as a controversial, picky sandwich conessier, I’m here to share my thoughts on some of the best and worst grilled cheeses I’ve ever had going out. I’m not including more “local” chains, like Cheesetique in Del Ray because 1. Why charge <em> $13</em> for a grilled cheese and 2. I worked there, so that also soured my opinion of their food. We’d also be here all day.</p> 

<p>So, lets get into it. Here are <b> seven </b> grilled cheeses that I’ve had the privilege of trying, my thoughts on them, and whether or not they’re worth <em> your </em> money.<p>
